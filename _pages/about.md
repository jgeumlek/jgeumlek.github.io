## Data Scientist, Machine Learning Researcher, PhD
## Educator

Dr. Joseph Geumlek is a Data Scientist employed at Kaiser Permanente. Joseph's doctoral specialization is in differential privacy and related notions for machine learning, with a focus on privatizing Bayesian methods.

Beyond Computer Science and Mathematics, Joseph also takes effective pedagogy seriously, and served as an instructor for several course offerings at UCSD.

Joseph is an advocate of open source software. His largest open source project is [MoltenGamepad](https://github.com/jgeumlek/MoltenGamepad/), a flexible userspace device driver daemon that overcomes shortcomings with the Linux input subsystem for interfacing video games with various controller devices.
