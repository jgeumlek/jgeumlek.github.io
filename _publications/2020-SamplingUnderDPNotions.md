title: "Sampling from Distributions under Differential Privacy Notions"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-SamplingUnderDPNotions
excerpt: 'This is my doctoral thesis, synthesizing all of my work completed during my PhD program at UCSD. It explores privacy notions for releasing samples and various methods for achieving them, ranging from privatizing sufficient statistics, changing the posterior update rule, combining soruces of uncertainty through the framework of diffusions, and hiding generating distributions through a convex optimization task.'

This is my doctoral thesis, synthesizing all of my work completed during my PhD program at UCSD. It explores privacy notions for releasing samples and various methods for achieving them, ranging from privatizing sufficient statistics, changing the posterior update rule, combining soruces of uncertainty through the framework of diffusions, and hiding generating distributions through a convex optimization task.
