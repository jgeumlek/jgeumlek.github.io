## Interests

My work interests are in machine learning, with a focus in privacy preserving techniques such as differential privacy. I am also interested in teaching and science communication.

Currently, I am taking some personal time after completing my graduate degree.

Outside of work, I enjoy video games and other such interactive fiction.
